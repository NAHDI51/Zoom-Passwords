Ever Since the corona outbreak, Zoom has been widespread and now is the most popular platform for hosting virtual meetings. Every classes, convocations, convensions, meetings
are now held in this platform. But it has its down sides.

When you are on a streak of consecutive meeting or class held in a meeting with the same credentials, fetching the user id and password again and again, repititively feels like
a drudgery. For instance, on my college, The weekly rendezvous with the same teachers providing the same credentials to join the meeting feels monotonous to fetch and enter.

Therefore, this project is intended to alleviate that monotonous work. This is a cli based program. It will save the creditentials you enter once in this program - forever in your computer, and
will give you certain functions and utilities for modifying and using them. 

The functionalities of the program are described explicitly inside the program. Use a command line terminal (CMD) or bash to open the program. 

I hope this program will help you with your problem. Thank you.
